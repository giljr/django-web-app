# django-web-app Fun Factory Archieve
Hi, this is all about [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) , a web framework for perfectionists with deadlines!
django is a full-stack, open-source Python framework designed for efficient web development.
This is learning by doing: I am using openclassrooms, a leading E-learning Platform!:rocket:

Go to 
[django-web-app Site Course](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/6967196-create-a-web-application-with-django)
```	
The idea is a MERCH - Merchandise Exchange site, with a list 
of my favorite bands and titles of other relevant information.

The material, to understand Django framework,
is envisaged as follows:

Part #1 - Lay the groundwork for our app using Models, Views, and Templates (MVT)
	
Part #2 - Begin a Django App Using Models, Views, and Templates

Part #3 - Manage our appâ€™s data, using the Django admin

Part #4 - Build a CRUD Interface in Django

```

I versioned every advance I made during the course (v1.0, v2.0 and so on).

Go to tags and download each working code package.

BTW, You're more then welcome to visit my Web Pages:

 [KidsTronics](https://medium.com/kidstronics) (MIT App Inventor, LEGO, Arduino For Kids, and more)
 
 I believe that the essential lessons can be learned about the systems - about the world - 
from taking things apart, seeing how they work, and using this knowledge to create new and even more interenting things.

These are the [Levy, Steven(2010)](https://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Computer-Revolution-Steven-Levy/dp/1449388396)'s **Hackers Ethic** principles (that I've valued most):
* *Access to computer* - and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works - should be unlimited and total.
* Always *yield to Hands-on Imperative*!
* *Hackers should be judged by their hacking*, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position;
* You can *create art and beauty* on a computer;
* Computer can *change your life for the better*.

Feel at ease to give some feedback!

Bye!
