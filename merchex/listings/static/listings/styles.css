/* 
Once you’re sure your CSS file is loading correctly, 
you can then edit the CSS file and begin to style your site how you’d like it

Alternatively, you don’t have to style the site at all - 
many of the HTML elements we’ll be using in this project 
will have default styling applied to them by your browser. 

If you’re happy with that, you can simply use a blank CSS file. 
This is what I’ll do for this code 

I’ve added  .errorlist { margin-bottom: -10px } to my CSS file 
to make it more obvious which error belongs to which input

To test css, uncomment background-color tag bellow:
*/

/* * {
    background-color: red;
} */
 

.errorlist { margin-bottom: -10px; 
    color: red;
}
